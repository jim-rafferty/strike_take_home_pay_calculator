#Strike take-home pay calculator

This is the source for a strike take home pay calculator (available [here](https://strike-pay-calculator.herokuapp.com/)). The deduction applied and reported by employers is usually before tax, NI and other normal deductions and makes the amount lost to employees look larger than it really is. Hopefully this is a useful tool to understand how much striking workers can expect to lose from their take home pay for taking strike action and plan accordingly.
